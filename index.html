            <h2>Early Years</h2>
            <p>
               My introduction to music began very early as a young child. 
               Some of my favorite memories of my papa include him brushing my hair as a child
               while singing me songs by The Beatles.  Music was ever-present at my home, during
               car rides, and during my dad's weekly band practices.  There was a piano in our living room
               that I would use to sound out the theme songs to my favorite movies and shows. 
               I took piano lessons with a couple different teachers before taking a small break
               from lessons.  Inspired by my dad's songwriting ability, I began writing my own lyrics
               and melodies.

            <h2>My First Guitar</h2>
            <p>
               My love for music was encouraged and deepened when my parents bought me my first guitar at age 9.
               'El Condor Pasa' by Simon and Garfunkel was the first song my dad taught me, followed by 'Norwegian Wood'
               by The Beatles.  Shortly thereafter, I began taking lessons again to strengthen my skills, and continued
               to write my own songs.  Being able to accompany myself changed how I wrote music for the better.  It was also
               around this point that I realized my love for singing.  I was too shy to sing or play in front of anyone,
               but I often cooped myself up in my room and sang along to my favorite songs or tried to learn them on guitar.

            <h2>My First Solo Performance</h2>
            <p>
               When I was 13, my guitar teacher held a concert for all of her students in her backyard. We each performed
               a song of our choice.  Because of my skill level, my teacher asked me to play alongside one of her younger
               students as well.  I still experienced some shyness and stage fright, but I had gotten over it enough
               to play through my nerves. I played and sang 'Price Tag' by Jessie J, and accompanied the younger student
               on 'You Belong With Me' by Taylor Swift.  My mom recorded my performances and I posted them to my facebook.
               I received lots of compliments from my friends and classmates, bolstering my confidence and determination
               to continue on my path as a musician.

            <h2>Highschool Choirs</h2>
            <p>
               Some highlights of highschool for me were the choirs I participated in.  At this point, I felt very confident
               in my skills as a singer and began favoring singing over other instruments.  I joined a women's chorus my 
               freshman year with my best friend Kaitlin, who I have always bonded with over our shared love for music. 
               Our sophomore year, we both joined a vocal jazz group called 'Prism' that met after school on Tuesdays, as well
               as an A Capella choir class.  My junior and senior years, I was in a vocal jazz class called 'Kaleidoscope'
               which was one of my favorite music classes I've ever taken.  It was through these choirs that I gained a lot 
               of experience performing with others and singing solos.  The director of every choir at the school, David Cannon, 
               shared his passion for choral music through his teaching, and instilled in us a feeling of deep 
               camraderie that remains in my heart today.

            <h2>A Rare Shade of Red</h2>
            <p>
               My sophomore year of highschool, I began dating a fellow musician named Logan and we formed a band.
               He played lead guitar, and I sang.  I was in charge of writing the lyrics and melodies, and he was in charge of
               writing the chord progressions and lead guitar parts.  We had contrasting backgrounds in music, but we managed 
               to write some good songs together despite our differences in taste.  Ultimately, neither the band nor
               the relationship worked out.  But the experience gave me valuable practice with collaboration, and allowed me 
               to reflect on what I truly want my music to convey.  It also eventually taught me to trust my
               own songwriting skills, and not let anyone else tell me otherwise.

            <h2>Columbia College Chicago</h2>
            <p>
               After graduating highschool, I decided to continue my music education at Columbia College Chicago.  Moving
               to Chicago was a big change, but an exciting one.  I enjoyed the music classes I took, and definitely gained
               important knowledge that I've utilized since then in my songwriting.  My freshman year, I recorded a couple of
               demos in my dormroom, marking the first time I had ever released any produced songs.  This was a great
               accomplishment for me, and made me feel like I was getting somewhere with my music.  However, I struggled with 
               keeping on a good practice schedule, and too often compared myself with others.  Unfortunately, I began letting 
               my creative pursuits slip, and started dealing with some mental health issues that eventually led me to drop out 
               of school my junior year and return to Saint Louis.  Throughout this time, I was still writing songs, but
               couldn't make myself take the necessary steps to record or release anything.

            <h2>Since College</h2>
            <p>
               In the past few years, I have struggled with my relationship with music.  Events in the past have made me
               question my drive to succeed and my ability to create good music.  There have been times where playing music
               has felt like a chore, and I have strongly doubted myself.  Collaboration remains to be an anxiety-inducing
               subject for me.  Despite everything, my love for music has never waned.  Despite everything, I have continued
               to write music, and the music I've written lately is the best I've ever made.  Slowly but surely, my dreams
               of becoming a recognized musician are returning to me.  I truly am proud of myself and
               I believe I am an incredible songwriter, even if the world doesn't know it yet.
